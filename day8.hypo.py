# Imagine you want to know how many people like chocolate ice cream in a whole city. You canâ€™t ask everyone, so you ask a sample (a smaller group). Suppose 60 out of 100 people in your sample say yes â€” that's 60% (sample proportion = 0.6).

# Now, suppose a company claims that only 50% of people like chocolate ice cream. You want to test if this claim is true based on your sample.

# ðŸ‘‰ This is called a large sample test for proportion â€” it helps us check if the sample result is different from the claimed proportion in the population.
# z= (p^ - p)/ âˆšp(1-p)/n  ---formula

# A phone company claims that 50% of people like their service.
# You ask 200 people, and 130 say yes (65%).
# Is their claim correct?
